### To install required libraries run :

1. Create virtual environment (add venv to gitignore)

```py
virtualenv venv
```

2. Install required libraries

```py

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### NOTE :

- Apart from this tensorflow and tensorflow_hub should be installed .
- The face-pose-estimation model is not final it is just a placeholder for now(will improve it as we get time).
- How to convert javascript array for image into image tensor that part is remaining.

Hope
